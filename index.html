            Hi! I'm Baz.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm a full-stack software developer who loves visualization, magical abstractions, and high-quality code.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Across my work and co-op experiences and personal projects, I've honed my skills across the entire web development stack.
            I have experience in back-end logic, web servers, databases, automated testing, visualization, front-end logic, and user interfaces.
            I enjoy learning new things as well as using battle-tested technologies to solve users' problems and delight them.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I'm interested in opportunities involving a subset of:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>back-end development</li>
            <li>full-stack development</li>
            <li>internal tooling</li>
            <li>visualization</li>
            <li>automated testing</li>
            <li>mentoring</li>
            <li>formal and informal leadership</li>
            <!-- TODO Nate suggested making this list shorter by a few items -->
        </ul>

        <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy bouldering, climbing, camping, and most things outdoors.

                <p>
                    Ah, my first job ever.
                    First of all, I'm glad you've read this far into my past.
                    And in hindsight, I learned a lot about work and about myself serving up Lebanese food a few blocks from the Downtown Eastside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed the <strong>challenge</strong> throughout the never-ending night shifts.
                    I learned a lot about working with a team and working under pressure.
                    On a busy night there's little room for error, so keeping <strong>tight</strong> communication with the kitchen was key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the pressure, I had to make sure all orders looked <strong>immaculate</strong> and followed the diners' dietary requests.
                    You could say this adds to my <strong>quality and testing</strong> experience -- except that I couldn't taste test a guest's hummus.

                <h5>More Details</h5>
                <p>
                    In April of 2018, I graduated with distinction with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science program.
                    In the four years I spent there, I hit the Deans' honor list on three years.
                    I'm grateful for the four semesters of co-op experience I gained during that time, which rounded out my education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my university career, I was committed to enrolling in the more interesting courses despite their difficulty.
                    In hindsight, these are the courses that taught me the most:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <flavor-text title="In this course I studied NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, complexity analysis, dynamic programming, and linear programming.">
                            Design and Analysis of Algorithms II
                        </flavor-text>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <flavor-text title="In this course I studied online algorithms, graph analysis, and big data techniques. For example, we studied bloom filters, PageRank, and streaming algorithms.">
                            Algorithms for Modern Datasets
                        </flavor-text>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <flavor-text title="In this course I developed feed-forward neural networks from scratch using back-propagation for simple number recognition. Later in the course we used TensorFlow to develop more elaborate neural networks for complex image recognition.">

                        </flavor-text>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <flavor-text title="In this course I studied classical AI techniques like alpha-beta pruning and genetic algorithms.">
                            Artificial Intelligence

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Then in my final year, I worked on my undergraduate honors project.
                    For my honors project, I developed a code execution engine that securely executes foreign, user-submitted programs.
                    The engine also verifies the programs' correctness and supports multiple languages.
                    This engine now backs Project Lovelace.
                    Head over to the projects section for more details.

                <p>
                    Every Friday and Saturday night at El Camino was a busy night.
                    I enjoyed it and my co-workers were fantastic people.
                    I grew a lot and learned things you'd probably never learn in the software world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you ever tried delivering two dozen tacos on a shared plate to 10 drunk people crammed in a booth and explaining whom each taco belongs to?
                    I can project my voice so well, and that's handy in a heated office Nerf gun battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building on my experience at Nuba, I got even better at <strong>multi-tasking</strong>.
                    My role was the bridge between the kitchen and the front.
                    As the only support staff on those busy nights, I had to <strong>coordinate</strong> with the servers, bartenders, cooks, and dishwasher to make sure the entire restaurant was running smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Near the end of my time there, I was <strong>training</strong> new people.
                    Working with guests also helped me gain invaluable customer service skills.
                    I've learned to anticipate guests' needs before they even think to ask.
                    In hindsight, these customers service skills have helped me greatly during my time in software desk jobs.

                <h5>More Details</h5>
                <p>
                    Once I realized I was doing well in school and in need of money, I decided to do take initiative and start tutoring.
                    I <a href="images/top-comp-tutor-poster.webp" target="_blank">designed a poster</a> with Photoshop, made copies at the university print shop, and made good use of my staple gun.
                    Having dozens of posters around campus brought a steady stream of clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I customized my session prep and teaching style based on my client's needs.
                    After all, tutoring a computer science student in discrete structures is different from helping an engineering student cram for his midterm. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tutoring my clients kept me afloat until I became a teaching assistant.
                    Well, the co-op income also helped a lot in paying my tuition and rent.

                    I consider this co-op placement my career warm-up before moving on to bigger and greater things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first half of my term, I manually executed test cases for Ciena's legacy network management product.
                    Nothing makes you appreciate automated testing more than that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second half, I fixed production bugs and wrote automated (thankfully!) tests.
                    I also learned to file bug reports so detailed and beautiful they bring a tear to even the most hardened developer's eye.

                <p>
                    I applied to be a teaching assistant (TA) for the rent money, but I stayed for the experience.
                    The passion for teaching I acquired from being a private tutor continued to grow in my TA experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I ended up being a TA four times for the following courses:

                </ul>
    
                <h5>My Favorite Co-op</h5>
                <p>
                    This was my, by far, my favorite placement because I was truly doing <strong>full-stack development</strong>.
                    I was fiddling with the database, implementing test frameworks, and creating beautiful visualizations with D3.js.
                    The fun started with my first project, which had me implement a data warehouse solution for the quality team.
                </p>

                <h5>The Data Warehouse</h5>
                <p>
                    I wrote ETL scripts in Python that captured hourly snapshots of the Jira instance to load into PostgreSQL.
                    At the database level, I created and optimized dozens of SQL queries and triggers that aggregated new data.
                    These aggregate views were in a format that could be visualized easily. 
                </p>

                <h5>Visualizing the Data in a Dashboard</h5>
                <p>
                    With the back-end done, I shifted to the front-end.
                    The objective was to provide visual reports on defects, trends, and project status in one dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve that, I developed a web interface that consisted of 12 <flavor-text title="The legends allowed you to add or remove data series. Also, the charts had slick animations when updated. Necessary? No. Sexy? Aboslutely.">interactive</flavor-text> D3.js chart visualizations.
                    The dashboard allowed users to filter the data in different ways, allowing management to easily discover product quality insights.
                </p>

                <h5>Developing a Test Framework</h5>
                <p>
                    After completing that project, I shifted gears to the team's fork of Apache Flume.
                    The problem was that this component was being tested manually every release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To save QA time, I designed and implemented a test automation framework <strong>from scratch</strong>.
                    Part of the challenge was having to simultaneously develop a Linux (using Bash) and Windows (using Powershell) version.
                    Both of them had to behave exactly the same and be compatible with the same test files, of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new framework allowed the QA team to save hours of manual labor by automating their manual test cases.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented significant <strong>network management features</strong> and created automated unit and integration tests.</li>
                    <li>Rewrote the team's test runner to parallelize test execution, <strong>reducing runtimes by 66%</strong> to 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Solved major <strong>production</strong> bugs in my team's micro-service, allowing the team to meet a tight deadline.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>New Challenges at Ciena</h5>
                <p>
                    I returned to Ciena in 2017 to work in a new division that was building the next-generation network management product.
                    I experienced working as though I were a full-time developer, and had an excellent mentor teach me a lot of software development and team dynamics.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Speeding up the Test Runner</h5>
                <p>
                    Early in my eight-month term, I noticed that the test framework took a <flavor-text title="About an hour and twenty minutes.">long time</flavor-text> to run.
                    This framework was a tool custom-built in Python by the team to run different kinds of tests involving the team's micro-service.
                    I realized that we could save loads of time by running most of the tests in parallel, but the team wasn't convinced it was possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To counter their reservations, I built a proof-of-concept that proved it was indeed possible to parallelize the framework.
                    With their blessing, I spent a couple of weeks on a full re-write of the framework.
                    After merging my changes, the team enjoyed test runtimes that were faster by about an hour!
                    Whereas a test run previously took an hour and twenty minutes, with my improvements that time was down to 30 minutes!
                </p>

                <h5>Production Feature Work</h5>
                <p>
                    Having proved myself with my work on the test framework, I started working alongside the team on feature work.
                    I took on the responsibility of implementing core product features for the micro-service.
                    Part of that was developing my suites of unit and integration tests, some of them developed in <flavor-text title="Test-driven development">TDD</flavor-text> style.
                    I also helped the team meet tight deadlines by solving major production bugs.
                    I concluded my term having successfully shipped a notable feature that was directly requested by customers.

                    After graduation, I decided to take a short sabbatical and unwind before jumping back into the software industry.
                    I set off from Ottawa and headed north-east.
                    I passed through all the eastern provinces, seeing friends, camping out, and crashing at dinky hostels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I made it to New Brunswick I met up with my brother who made his way up on his motorcycle.
                    We visited Prince Edward Island together before heading down to Boston together.
                    I ended my trip when I had to return back to Ottawa for my graduation ceremony in June.

                    With summer in full swing, I made my way to Muskoka to work at a kid's camp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Camp Winston is an overnight summer camp for children with multiple neurological disorders like autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder.
                    The time I spent here was incredibly rewarding and will stay with me as long as I live. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the camp, I was a full-time counselor working with groups of 4-5 campers for two weeks at a time.
                    During these two weeks, we would help the campers learn new skills like learning to ride a bike or tying their shoelaces.
                    We would also work on building up their confidence, self-esteem, and social skills.
                    We would also support the campers through difficult and emotional episodes, coaching them and helping them process difficult emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my regular duties and responsibilities, I was also a ropes instructor.
                    I received high ropes training that allowed me to facilitate the roped adventure activities at the camp.
                    Not only did this match my love for rock climbing, being a ropes instructor meant being one of the coolest counselors in the kids' eyes.

                <p>
                    Soon after joining Kinaxis I took the opportunity to join an exciting new team.
                    Our objective was to create innovative new ways to visualize supply chain data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our first project, we designed and produced a generic graph-based visualization.
                    As the only test developer, I was <strong>solely responsible</strong> for quality.
                    The visualization had over a dozen <flavor-text title="Node color, node title, node subgroup, link color, link style, etc.">dimensions of configuration</flavor-text>.
                    Being so configurable and flexible made the feature a challenge to test.
                    Each sub-component could interact with other sub-components, so I have to be thorough in my testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To that end, I set up a test framework and <strong>automated</strong> nightly builds along with a comprehensive suite of component and integration-level tests.
                    In the process, I instilled a deep appreciation for testing across the team.
                    We started <strong>catching defects earlier</strong> in the development cycle and completely preventing regressions.
                    Using a dashboard in Jira, I created viz quality metrics that we could follow to gauge our quality level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We went from having no tests to merging unit and/or integrations tests in <strong>every pull request</strong>.
                    By the end of the project, it turned out that I had caught a <flavor-text title="That is 73 true bugs, or 90 if you include bugs found by other employees during the internal beta program. I've excluded duplicates, clones, and invalids.">whopping 73 bugs</flavor-text>.
                </p>

                    from when we released this feature.

                <p>
                    Later on I worked on the Timeline visualization project.
                    It was for this feature that I was named one of the co-inventors on the <strong>patent</strong>.
                    On the test side, I sought to continue upping the team's quality bar.

                <p>
                    Noticing that we need more user involvement, I championed and personally facilitated two internal <strong>beta programs</strong> to test our assumptions and sharpen our designs.
                    I'm proud of how the beta program resulted in improving our understanding.
                    We completely <strong>re-designed</strong> the feature thanks to the feedback we got in the beta.
                    The re-design ended up vastly improving the power, <strong>usability</strong>, and long-term extensibility of the visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the team, I <strong>evangelized</strong> my team's visualizations to internal audiences.
                    I relied on different methods to achieve this.
                    First, I relied on my internal network and spread awareness through word of mouth.
                    Second, I presented keynote presentations to large R&D audiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This effort not only brought more feedback to our work.
                    It also allowed me to help others with their jobs.
                    For development and support teams, this meant helping them visualize and better understand supply chain data.
                    For customer-facing sales and consultant teams, this meant <flavor-text title="While I don't have hard numbers, I imagine this has helped us get some customers to sign on the dotted line.">spicing up their demos</flavor-text> by showing off the new visualization capabilities.
                </p>

                <h5>Growing the Team</h5>
                <p>
                    Throughout my time at Kinaxis, I was always keen on building the best team possible.
                    A few months into joining the team, I saw the opportunity to fill the scrum master role.
                    I took it on because I could see the team was functioning haphazardly and needed better processes.
                    A few months later, our improved reporting, communication, and planning made us more predictable and allowed us to get much better feedback from stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we grew the team I participated in interviewing and hiring junior members.
                    I thoroughly enjoyed mentoring new members on both sides: developers and testers.
                    I helped fill gaps in their software development knowledge, as well as testing principles and test framework design.
                    In the past year, the team I helped build has been delivering on all projects <strong>on schedule</strong>.
                    All without sacrificing quality.
                </p>

                <h5>CI/CD</h5>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned earlier, I set up the CI pipelines that our new team needed during the Network visualization project.
                    I got our new tests running in nightly builds, assuring us we have no regressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Timeline visualization project, I implemented <strong>running tests in CI</strong> on our pull requests.
                    This further helped us keep a clean master and save time for developers.
                    More recently, I integrated the team's repositories into SonarQube for <strong>static code analysis</strong> to prevent code smells and security vulnerabilities.
                </p>

                <h5>Working Remotely</h5>
                <p>
                    When the pandemic forced the team to go remote, I got creative to keep us going.
                    Realizing that written documentation is even more important now, I ensured our team processes and onboarding were clear and well-documented.
                    I also organized regular coffee time and online games (our team loves <flavor-text title="Party packs 2 and 7 were the biggest hits with my team. You should also check out the online Codenames games at https://codenames.game">Jackbox</flavor-text>!) to help the team have fun and stay connected.
                    Today, we're still going strong despite spreading out to
                    <flavor-text title="In 2019, we were entirely based in the Eastern time zone. In 2021, we're in the Eastern, Mountain, and Pacific time zones! At one point, that number was 4 because we had a co-op in Newfoundland!">

                <h5>Teaching Experience</h5>
                <p>
                    The opportunity to teach and mentor is something I cherish in my work.
                    I love taking someone from "what?" to the "aha!" moment where the pieces fall nicely into place.
                    That's why I'm keen on working at places that foster mentorship and learning.
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="experience-group-text" id="people-experience">
                <h5>Why do I include non-software experience?</h5>
                <p>
                    The longer I work in the software industry, the more I learn that communication, collaboration, and general people skills are key to good software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To that end, I proudly list my non-software experience because I believe that <strong>soft skills are as necessary as technical skills</strong> when tackling big challenges as a team.
                    I've discovered that these experiences have helped me immensely in collaborating as part of a team and in taking the lead and bringing others on board.

            <p>
                <a href="https://projectlovelace.net" target="_blank">Project Lovelace</a> is an <strong>online learning platform</strong> for people who want to learn to code.
                The platform is similar to others like Project Euler or Leetcode but geared towards science students.
                Our key differentiator is providing intriguing problems from all branches of the natural, social, and mathematical sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our hope is that science students will be more interested in learning if the problems are more interesting than the <flavor-text title="Like validating parentheses, or implementing efficient sorting algorithms.">typical</flavor-text> computer science problems found on Leetcode!
                And so far, we've had over <strong>10,000 code submissions</strong> from users all over the world!
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a project I tackled with my brother, who has studied physics and computational climate modeling.
                While he created the problems for the platform, I developed the website and backend.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I developed the <flavor-text title="A common term for a program test programs for correctness in programming contests against a set of known test cases.">online judge</flavor-text> using Python.
                We wanted to allow users to submit programs in <strong>different languages</strong>, which required an extensible design.
                Of course, the judge also had to be <strong>secure</strong>.
                For that, I used Linux Containers (LXC).
                LXC allowed me to easily sandbox user programs, preventing them from accessing the network, interacting with other files, or hogging <flavor-text title="CPU, RAM, and disk space.">system resources</flavor-text>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the online judge ready, I developed the website.
                I learned to use the <strong>Django</strong> web framework along with a handy CSS framework called Bulma.
                Also on the backend is our <strong>PostgreSQL database</strong>.
                We use it to store information about the problems, user accounts, as well as user submissions.

                It all started with a question. Who is the <flavor-text title="">Paul Erdős</flavor-text> of the music world? Erdős is known for being the most prolific collaborator in mathematics. Meaning he has more paper collaborations than any other mathematician, dead or alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hypothesized was that <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong> would be the answer. He seems to collaborate with everyone! Including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Urjas5Nt0I">collaboration</a> with Egyptian superstar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamer_Hosny" target="_blank">Tamer Hosny</a>. To answer this question, I needed data. Lots of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, the massive and freely available MusicBrainz database is just what I needed.
                I started with some data processing inside the <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database.
                Using SQL, I quickly aggregated all <flavor-text title="The edges of the graph. The number of unique collaborations acted as the edge weight.">collaborations</flavor-text> between <flavor-text title="The vertices of the graph.">artists</flavor-text>.
                Then, I exported the data I needed to begin <strong>graph analysis</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used Python's <a href="https://networkx.org/" target="_blank">NetworkX library</a> to find the shortest paths between every pair of artists.
                This helped me answer the question: who's the Paul Erdős of the music world?
                Shockingly, my hypothesis was correct! It is indeed Snoop Dogg by a <flavor-text title="Snoop's got 803 unique collaborations! He's far ahead of Busta Rhymes in 2nd place and with 549 collaborations, and Lil Wayne in 3rd place with 548.">wide margin</flavor-text>!
            </p>
            <p>
                For fun, I continued my analysis further with a graph analysis and <strong>visualization</strong> tool called <a href="https://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi</a>.
                I found that there were community-finding algorithms that could identify communities within the collaboration graph.
                I was able to produce some beautiful visuals and learn a lot about graphs in the process.

                For the final project of my neural networks course, I teamed up with a friend to build a <strong>classifier</strong> for the famous <strong>ImageNet</strong> dataset.
                We investigated and compared the performance of state-of-the-art <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> (CNNs) for image recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to use <strong>TensorFlow</strong> to classify the Tiny ImageNet dataset, a simpler version of the regular ImageNet dataset.
                We referred to network structures and techniques used by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640" target="_blank">YOLO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet" target="_blank">AlexNet</a> and derived simplified versions that we could run on a single GTX 970 GPU card.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our project involved lots of tuning and experimenting and failing and plenty of troubleshooting.
                Considering our lack of beefy hardware, we were happy to achieve a <strong>top-1 accuracy of 30%</strong> in the end.

            <p>
                For my third-year software engineering course, my group and I developed an <strong>Android</strong> app.
                The application allows you to spontaneously discover events occurring nearby.
                By overlaying tweets on <strong>Google Maps</strong>, we show users where there is lots of activity in their city.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we did well in the course, this project was an <strong>interesting lesson</strong> for me.
                While planning, we assumed that there was enough data for the app to be useful.
                Near the end of the project, we found out that only a tiny minority of tweets are geotagged.
                And in that subset of tweets, many of them were businesses advertising their services, not individuals broadcasting impromptu happenings around town.
                That really taught me the importance of prototyping and <strong>challenging assumptions</strong> early in the software development life cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
               On the positive side, we created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3FNLULdlfI" target="_blank">goofy video</a> to present the app to the class!

                This project was my final assignment for my <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> course at Carleton.
                As a big fan of a good drum n' bass mix, I wanted a program to create aesthetically pleasing playlists from a collection of songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used a <strong>genetic algorithm</strong> implemented in Python for this project.
                The algorithm uses mutation and cross-selection in concert with a loss function to quickly generate a flowing playlist.
